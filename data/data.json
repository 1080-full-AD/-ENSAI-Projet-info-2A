The store's proprietor is an enigmatic young man who goes by the name of Count D.\n\nCount D welcomes those who feel lonely and wounded through the doors of his shop, claiming to sell \"love, dreams, and hope\" in the form of the fantastic beasts that lie within. Each creature comes with a special contract accompanied by a set of rules. However, he warns customers that he cannot be held accountable for any consequences of breaking the rules.\n\nShort-tempered detective Leon Orcot traces the source of several crimes back to Count D and what the former considers to be a pet shop of horrors. Determined to find proof that the Count is a criminal, he begins to pay regular visits to the shop.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]", "background": "Petshop of Horrors was published in English as Pet Shop of Horrors by Tokyopop from June 17, 2003 to January 11, 2005.
